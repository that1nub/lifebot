This GitHub repository isn't going to have much code on it unless I make my bot open source, such as it being discontinued. 

In this repository, you will see any change logs. You can report any bugs found or ask the community for help on the bot.

I may post small code snips here for people who want to make a bot and need some help, but I will not disclose every little
thing if I feel it may do something I don't support, such as being malicious.
