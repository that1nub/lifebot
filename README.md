# LifeBot GitHub
Here on this repository, you won't find my bot. This is just for you to ask questions, and submit bug reports with the steps to how you found the bug.
# What will be shared here
Here you will mostly just see new update logs that are also shared on my [Discord](https://discord.gg/pjbemj4). I may post some code snips to help people with their own bot, but none will be posted if I feel they are innapropriate/malicious.
# If you ever see my bot's code
If I post the bot's code here, it means I have decided to discontinue it and it won't be worked on again. It'll be open source for anyone to look at.
