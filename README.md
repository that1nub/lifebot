# Installing
Download and extract files. Then create two folders: `data` and `config`. This is where data gets stored.

# I have not uploaded node modules
My internet is slow when it comes to uploading. There are a lot of files used with this, I will list them some time in the future.
An example of my incredibly slow upload speed, it takes me two hours, *maybe even more* to upload a 50 minute video to YouTube.
